________USAGE________
TXT FILENAME
WHERE FILENAME IS A LOCATION TO A FILE, USING A SLASH INSTEAD OF A BACKSLASH, AND AN ASTERISK INSTEAD OF A TILDE, IF NEEDED.
REMEMBER, THE TXT MODULE REQUIRES YOU TO USE DOS'S 8.3 CONVENTION, SO IF YOUR FILENAME IS NAMED 'ILIKEPIEVERYMUCH.TXT' AND RESIDES INSIDE YOUR ROOT NOCTIS FOLDER, YOU NEED TO USE 'TXT ../ILIKEP*1.TXT' TO LOAD IT. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE 8.3 FILENAME CONVENTION, SEE WIKIPEDIA'S '8.3 FILENAME' ARTICLE.
