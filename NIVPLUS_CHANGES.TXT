Changelog
---------



Release 0:

Vanilla Noctis IV, with the 'speedup' disabled


Release 1:

ADD: 'm' is now an alias for taking a snapshot, and 'n' is now an alias for taking a panoramic shapshot
FIX: Panoramic snapshots don't bug up Noctis IV anymore
CHANGE: Speedup on the roof of the stardrifter is now enabled.


Release 2:
CHANGE: Kicked supports.nct out of noctis.exe (it's now a seperate file again inside the DATA folder)
CHANGE: Small internal changes (#include defs.h)
ADD: Makefile, compile.bat
ADD: 'b' and 'delete' are now aliases for taking a 'raw' snapshot (without starname/planetname data)
ADD: Jetpack and jumping (including the 'c' jetpack directonal control cutoff key)
CHANGE: Snapshots are now numbered NICE-style ('00000001.BMP') instead of NIV-style ('SNAP0001.BMP'). This allows for way more screenshots.
ADD: Mouselook. Hit the UP key whilst on a surface to change mouselook (there are 3 modes). Doesn't work in space.
ADD: Omega Drive. No flashy Omega Drive status inside the SD though, and you'll have to hexedit your current.bin to enable it.. ;)
ADD: Moviemaker (works also in space, same controls as in NICE plus a pause function and some other improvements; moviemaking manual has also been added to the package).
ADD: Raw snapshot while in space (I don't really know if this feature was lost...).
ADD: Radius info now displayed in the Remote and Local target data windows.
ADD: Status messages on surface now work (ie: mouselook change).
FIX: 'm' key snapshot doesn't bug labeling anymore.
CHANGE: Extended viewfield of objects.
CHANGE: Roofspeed has now a switch to control it (press 's' while in the SD).
ADD: Bundled 'help.com' module again

Release 2.1:
NOTE: I didn't update this package with the new starmap and guide for almost 2 months. So the occasion of finally updating the archive, made me feel I had to fix these little bugs. April, 2009 starmap update has been incorporated.
FIX: DL module has been updated. It now correctly shows the number of notes of the main object, if queried about a planet (previously it still showed the # of notes of the star).
FIX: 's' and 'p' don't activate their respective functions when labeling, anymore.
